👋 Hey there! I'm Chris Miller

I really enjoy making new and unique things whenever I get a good idea.
My favorite things to make are websites, Minecraft server plugins, Discord bots, and shenanigans.

🎧 This week I've listened to 411 songs with an average of 58 per day<br>
💻 I've coded for 5 hrs 11 mins (1 hr 43 mins daily) with my top language this week being Kotlin
