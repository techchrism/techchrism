👋 Hey there! I'm Chris

I really enjoy making new and unique things whenever I get a good idea.
My favorite things to make are websites, Minecraft server plugins, Discord bots, and shenanigans.

💻 I've coded for 20 hrs 54 mins (2 hrs 59 mins daily)<br>
📊 My top language this week is TypeScript which I've spent 8 hrs 33 mins in
