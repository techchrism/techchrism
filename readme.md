ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Chris

I really enjoy making new and unique things whenever I get a good idea.
My favorite things to make are websites, Minecraft server plugins, Discord bots, and shenanigans.

ðŸŽ§ This week I've listened to 115 tracks with an average of 16 tracks per day<br>
ðŸ’» I've coded for 15 hrs 49 mins (2 hrs 15 mins daily)<br>
ðŸ“Š My top language this week is C++ which I've spent 7 hrs 4 mins in
