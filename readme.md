ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Chris

I really enjoy making new and unique things whenever I get a good idea.
My favorite things to make are websites, Minecraft server plugins, Discord bots, and shenanigans.

ðŸ’» I've coded for 14 hrs 45 mins (2 hrs 6 mins daily)<br>
ðŸ“Š My top language this week is JavaScript which I've spent 6 hrs 35 mins in
